# Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data Set

### Background
The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Analysis
In this project we try to predict the house pricing based on the information provided in the data set such as the number of rooms per house, the criminality rate or the pupil-teacher ratio by town using linear regression models.
